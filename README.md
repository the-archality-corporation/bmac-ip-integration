# BiFlow MAC Arrays (Matrix Multiply) — IP Integration Guide

This repository is currently a work in progress for BiFlow MAC Arrays (BMAC), a new class of compute silicon blocks and chiplets targeting **efficient AI inference at every scale**.  
This repo contains **no proprietary RTL or device-level IP**. It exists to provide safe public documentation, example workflows for integration partners.

---

## Why BMAC?
AI inference is increasingly **memory- and power-bound**. Scaling models from billions to trillions of parameters stresses today’s accelerators.  
BMAC rethinks how multiply–accumulate (MAC) operations are orchestrated, aiming to restore **compute, not memory, as the bottleneck**.

---

## What’s Inside
- **docs/problem-space.md** — overview of today’s bottlenecks in AI inference  
- **docs/roadmap.md** — future plans for benchmarks and integration guides  
- **examples/integration.md** — placeholder notes for how BMAC could slot into a standard SoC or accelerator  

---

## Roadmap
Planned safe contributions here include:
- **Integration Notes:** high-level design flow documents for SoC or FPGA teams
- **PDK Expansions:** how to request access to validated flows with PDKs (we do not provide the PDKs)
- **Partner Hooks:** where to find documentation on IP licensing, evaluation, and support

---

## Today
Right now this repo contains **only placeholders**. The real IP lives elsewhere under non-public licensing and NDAs.

---

## Contributing
No contribution is allowed, this is a public reference reposoitory.
